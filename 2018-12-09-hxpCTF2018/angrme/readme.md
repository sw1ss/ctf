I hope you do not need more than three lines of python to solve this.

# Solution

I got a binary and the hint that it is solvable with the symbolic execution framework "angr".
After using taking a small overview with r2 I figured it only had two paths, one which lead to ":)" in stdout and multiple jumps to ":(".

So I used angr to search for ':)'


```python
import angr
import claripy

proj = angr.Project('angrme')
simgr = proj.factory.simgr()
simgr.explore(find=lambda s: b":)" in s.posix.dumps(1))
s = simgr.found[0]
print(s.posix.dumps(0))
```
